# Angsd-YM
This is the work repository for Next-Gen-Seq Angsd Individual Project

To store R studio project, scripts, and any documents geneated during analysis

I have two versions of R-markdown records. One is an old version of records that keep notes of what I performed (may contain errors in scipts and analysis). This old documnet is only for record-keeping purpose. DO NOT USE!!!! (Temporary storage, will be deleted before final submission)

The other new version of R markdown documnet is the one with correct tracking of everything I have performed. All analysis ran and files generated in this document will be used for further analysis and submitted.

Only the intermediate files/images/reports generated (e.g. FASTQC, Alignment/QoRTs QC, multiQC etc) according to scripts kept in the new version of R markdown document will be uploaded here.
