This is the work repository for Next-Gen-Seq Angsd Individual Project of Yinuo (Cathy) Meng (yim4002)

To store R studio project, scripts, and any documents geneated during analysis

I have two versions of R-markdown records. One is an old version of records that keep notes of what I performed (may contain errors in scripts and analysis). This old document is only for record-keeping purpose. (named: "Project_R_oldrecord.rmd") 
***DO NOT USE!!!! (Temporary storage, will be deleted before final submission)***

The other new version of R markdown document is the one with correct tracking of everything I have performed. All analysis ran and files generated in this document will be used for further analysis and submitted. (***named: "Project_R_newrecord_fixedalign.rmd"***)

Any intermediate files generated in analysis for both versions were downloaded and stored in this project directory. However, the old and new versions were separately stored in different folders.
***Except for fastqc files***
